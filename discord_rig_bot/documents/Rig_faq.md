impl Tool for MyCustomTool {
    const NAME: &'static str = "my_custom_tool";
    type Error = MyToolError;
    type Args = MyToolArgs;
    type Output = MyToolOutput;

    async fn call(&self, args: Self::Args) -> Result<Self::Output, Self::Error> {
        // Implement tool logic
    }

    async fn definition(&self, _prompt: String) -> ToolDefinition {
        // Define tool interface
    }
}
```

11. Q: How can I use Rig for multi-turn conversations?
A: Use the `chat` method and maintain a conversation history:

```rust
let mut history = Vec::new();
loop {
    let user_input = get_user_input();
    let response = agent.chat(&user_input, history.clone()).await?;
    history.push(Message { role: "user".into(), content: user_input });
    history.push(Message { role: "assistant".into(), content: response.clone() });
    println!("Assistant: {}", response);
}
```

12. Q: How do I implement custom tokenization with Rig?
A: Rig uses the tokenizers provided by LLM providers. For custom tokenization, you'd need to implement it at the application level:

```rust
fn custom_tokenize(text: &str) -> Vec<String> {
    // Your custom tokenization logic
}

let tokenized = custom_tokenize(&user_input);
let response = agent.prompt(&tokenized.join(" ")).await?;
```

13. Q: How can I use Rig for few-shot learning?
A: Include examples in your prompt or preamble:

```rust
let few_shot_agent = openai_client.agent("gpt-3.5-turbo")
    .preamble("
        Classify the sentiment of the text. Examples:
        Input: I love this product!
        Output: Positive
        Input: This is terrible.
        Output: Negative
        Now classify the following:
    ")
    .build();
```
