# Concurrent Processing with [Rig](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig)

This example demonstrates how to use [Rig](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig), a powerful Rust library for building LLM-powered applications, to perform concurrent processing of LLM tasks. This approach significantly improves performance when dealing with multiple LLM queries, making it ideal for batch processing or high-throughput scenarios.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

You'll also need an OpenAI or Cohere API key. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [OpenAI's website](https://openai.com) or [Cohere's website](https://cohere.com/)

### Setup

1. Create a new Rust project:
   ```
   cargo new rig-concurrent-processing
   cd rig-concurrent-processing
   ```

2. Add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml`:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   rig-core = "0.1.0"
   tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
   ```

3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Code Overview

The main components of this example are:

1. OpenAI client initialization.
2. Creation of a shared GPT-3.5-turbo model instance.
3. Spawning of multiple concurrent tasks using Tokio.
4. Concurrent execution of LLM queries.
5. Collection and display of results.

### Running the Example

1. Copy the provided code into your `src/main.rs` file.
2. Run the example using:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```

### Customization

You can easily modify this example to suit your specific use case:
- Change the number of concurrent tasks by adjusting the loop range.
- Modify the prompt to generate different types of content.
- Experiment with different OpenAI models by changing the model name.

### Performance Considerations

- Be mindful of OpenAI's rate limits when increasing concurrency.
- Monitor system resource usage to optimize the number of concurrent tasks.
- Consider implementing error handling and retry logic for production use.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
- Ensure your OpenAI API key is correctly set.
- Check that all dependencies are properly installed.
- Verify that you're using a compatible Rust version.
